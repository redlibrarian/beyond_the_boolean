          <h3>Precision and Recall</h3>
          <p>Precision: the proportion of relevant results to total
          results. How many true positives vs false positives?</p>
          <p>Recall: the proportion of relevant results to total record
          set. How many true positives were not returned?</p>
          <p>There are other measures of information retrieval; these
          are two basic ones that tend to be important to library
          work.</p>

        <section style="text-align:left">
        <p>Boolean logic presumes that there are only two states:
        positive and negative.</p>
        <p>Boolean search strings try for maximum recall and maximum
        precision (all relevant results returned with fewest false
        positives).</p><p>In practice this is impossible for non-trivial
        cases.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
        <p>Method: chaining together boolean terms, with parentheses for
        precedence. This attempts to configure a query for maximum
        precision and recall <strong>before</strong> the search is run.</p>

          <p>Which means that the logical model for querying all this

          <h3>Information Retrieval Models</h3>
          <p>Three main types:</p>
          <ul><li>Based on set theory (e.g. Boolean)</li>
              <li>Based on linear algebra (e.g. Vector space model)</li>
              <li>Based on probability/statistics</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p style="text-align:left">
          Each model has benefits and disadvantages; one size does not
          fit all.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Boolean model</h3>
          <p>Creates sets based on which documents match a current
          query term; the returned results are the union (OR), intersection
          (AND), or complement (NOT) of the sets for each query
          term.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Vector-space model</h3>
          <p>Creates a graph with axes corresponding to all search
          terms, then plots all results on that graph. The query is a
          vector (straight line) that fits the graph best; result points
          that are closest to the line are more relevant than those that
          are further away.</p>

        <section>
          <p style="text-align=left">The Vector-Space Model allows us
          more flexibility than the simpler set-theory Boolean model. It
          ranks each document in a corpus by how relevent it is to a
          given query. This allows for result sets to be more applicable
          to researchers, and exposes the long-tail of less relevant
          results. It is less concerned with maximizing precision and
          recall <strong>before</strong> a search is run, than with
          allowing users to explore results, tweaking precision and
          recall <strong>after</strong> the search is run (either
          through facets, or modifying the search terms.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>In general, the idea behind the VSM is the more times a
          query term appears in a document relative to the number of
          times the term appears in all the documents in the collection,
          the more relevant that document is to the query. </p>

          <h3>Solr and ElasticSearch</h3>
          <img src="images/solr.png" height="200px"/>
          <img src="images/elasticsearch-logo.png" height="200px"/>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Based on the Lucene indexing and querying library, written
          in Java. Lucene allows for various information retrieval
          models. Lucene uses boolean to remove completely irrelevant results,
          then uses VSM to construct a relevancy-ranked result set.</p>
          <p>Both Solr and ElasticSearch use this combination of models,
          but they add other features to give more flexibility/precision
          to the scoring/weighting of documents.</p>

              <li>Search engine configuration</li>
